# 8086-Assembler-using-Python-with-GUI
  This project is implemented in python using GUI. Here, The user will be able to write the code in the given space(textbox area), user will be able to save the written code to the selected folder, open the already saved file, edit the old file and save it. After saving the code, user will be able to run/compile the code via given options. After, Clicking the compile option the assembler will check for the error if any. When it is error free, it will generated the hex file with machine level code with the name ‘filename_hex.h’. After the compilation is completed you can check the values of all the registers through the option ‘RegisterValues’. 
  For the primary use we have just implemented it for the basis 18 instructions. The list of instructions are as follows : 'MOV' , 'XCHG' , 'ADD' , 'INC' , 'SUB' , 'DEC' , 'NEG' , 'MUL' , 'NOT' , 'OR' , 'AND' ,  'NAND' , 'NOR' , 'SHR' , 'STC' , 'CLC' , 'CMC' , 'CLD'.
